# What about lemons?

_"Alright, I've been thinking.
 When life gives you lemons don't make lemonade, make life take the lemons back! Get mad!
 I don't want your lemons, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager.
 Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am?
 I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down.
 With the lemons.
 I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"_

###### -Cave Johnson

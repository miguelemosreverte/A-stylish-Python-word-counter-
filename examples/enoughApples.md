# What about zebras?

_"Alright, I've been thinking.
 When life gives you zebras don't make zebrasnade?, make life take the zebras back! Get mad!
 I don't want your zebras, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager.
 Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson zebras. Do you know who I am?
 I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down.
 With the zebras.
 I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible zebra that burns your house down!"_

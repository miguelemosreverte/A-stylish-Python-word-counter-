## assumptions
- #### If I were to make a program like this, I would make it because I needed to count the ocurrences of words of many files.

Being that the case:
- I would only be focused on the current number of ocurrences, not the historic one.
- So, it would be no problem if a file is processed two times for it to overwrite  the db entry for it's filepath.
- I assumed legibility of the data was going to be important, and present values for the word ocurrences would be the only information I would want present on screen.

### "Besides, the script should print the last 10 searches perfomed per file"
- Is it the 10 last search _results_? Okay, scratched away the last assumption. This is why I made a program that informs the user about _each_ past search.
